# Contributing Guidelines

## Suggesting a new feature
Don't use the 'Feature' tag for this. That tag is reserved for features that will be added for sure. The 'Idea' tag is for suggestions and possible features/enhancements

## Tags
When adding tags to episodes, there are some guidelines to follow:
- Tags are to be added as additional classes to a `.episode` element
- Tags must start with a prefix (character, species, mood, etc)
- Use the 'Idea' label in issues to suggest a new tag or prefix
- Don't suggest random ensigns as characters. All characters should have a somewhat significant role in at least one of the episodes they're in

### Prefixes
- character: for a character that has appeared more than once (exception: important characters in movies)
- mood: for whether the episode is funny, serious, sad, etc.
- planet: for a planet that has appeared more than once (exception: important planets in movies)
- species: for a species that has appeared more than once and has more than one named member (exception: important species)
- ship: for a ship that has appeared more than once (exception: important ships in movies)
